            Evaluation on Latex DRC60 Modified Bituminous Concrete Wearing Course</h1>
        <p>Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which traffic travels which is likely to
            undergo early deterioration. This necessitates the need for frequent maintenance and there by increases the
            expenditure. Since the problem of deterioration is related to the properties of bituminous concrete mix,
            researches have been conducted to improve the properties of the mix using additives like nanomaterials,
            marble dust, latex etc. The objective of this study is to modify pure bitumen using latex DRC60 and evaluate
            the physical properties of the blend so as to determine its optimum content in bitumen. Further Marshall mix
            design was carried out for bituminous concrete layer using the modified latex bitumen blend at various
            binder contents. The specimens were tested for Marshall stability and flow values as well as the density and
            void calculations. The studies conducted showed that bitumen modified with latex DRC60 had better physical
            properties and the modified mix had better strength compared to that of conventional bitumen.</p>

        <p>Pavement, in civil engineering is a durable surfacing of a road, airstrip, or similar area whose primary
            function is to transmit loads to the sub-base and underlying soil. Pavements may be either flexible, rigid
            or semi-rigid, according to their relative flexural stiffness. Rigid pavements are made of Portland cement
            concrete. Semi-rigid pavements are those having some type of chemically stabilized (pozzolanic) layer below
            the bituminous concrete layer. A flexible pavement structure is typically composed of several layers of
            materials each receiving loads from the layers above and spreading it to the next layer below. Bituminous
            wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which the traffic runs including any dense graded
            bituminous course immediately below a course of open graded bitumen.
            One of the major disadvantage of flexible pavement over rigid pavement is early deterioration of surface
            which can be overcome by improving the physical properties of wearing course. Several ways to improve the
            physical properties of pavement includes use of additives such as nano materials, latex, marble dust,
            styrene-butadiene-styrene polymers etc. Conventional bituminous concrete formula using the Marshall method
            has been shown to fail very rapidly due to heavy traffic and environmental effects. To minimize this
            deterioration, it is necessary to pay extra attention to material selection and one solution is to formulate
            an bituminous mix that has a high physical properties and one way to do this is to use latex as an additive.

        <p>Bituminous pavements are subjected to faster deterioration which will result in higher maintenance and
            operation cost.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving the physical properties of wearing course can increase the strength of the pavement and
                resistance to deformations, rutting, fatigue as well as skid. On the whole this can improve the overall
                durability of the pavement.</li>
            <li>Improvement in pavement characteristics like friction and skid resistance can reduce the vehicle
                operation cost.</li>
            <li>The bitumen used is of VG 30 and latex used of DRC60 so the test results are only comprising to this
                bitumen grade and latex grade</li>
            <li>If addition of latex can improve these properties it will be a great boon. The increased demand for
                latex in the bituminous mix design can encourage farmers in the field of rubber plantations. Evaluation
                of performance of mix will be conducted for various percentages of latex from 0 to 7% and the optimum
                mix will be selected.</li>

        <p>Conventional bitumen has been modified using addition of various additives since years. Among these studies,
            theone with the addition of crumb rubber was the earliest. Discarded tyres from vehicles were used to modify
            the bituminous mixes. They were ground to different sizes and graded like aggregates. For a well graded mix,
            about 10% crumb rubber in bitumen was found to improve the rutting resistance and while gap graded mixes had
            longer fatigue life but poor rutting resistance (Palit et al. 2004)[9]. Addition of crumb rubber into
            bitumen was found to be one way of reducing the quantity of waste generated but even then it was
            uneconomical considering the costs incurred in grinding and grading of the waste tyres. Thus other additives
            like latex, nanomaterials etc. came into effect and the studies became prominent. Bitumen with 7% latex by
            weight of bitumen exhibited least temperature sensitivity, enhanced fatigue and rutting resistance (Wen et
            al. 2015)[5]. On the other hand, 4% latex by weight of bitumen was found to be the optimum content by
            varying the concentration of latex from 0 to 6% (Siswanto 2016)[1]. The rate of deterioration in the
            modified mixes were decreased since the addition of latex improved the dynamic stability. Moreover the shelf
            life of the modified mix was improved due to better dispersion of natural rubber latex in bitumen owing to
            its small particle size (Siswanto 2017)[3]. About 15% natural rubber latex in bitumen obtained lower
            penetration value as well as reduced penetration index, increased softening point and highest rutting
            resistance (Bakar et al. 2018)[6]. The mixing variables like mixing time, mixing temperature and mixing
            speed had influence on the properties of the modified blends so obtained. These variables affect the
            dispersion of modifiers in bitumen and thus the strength of the mix thus prepared. A mixing time of 60
            minutes, mixing temperature of 160°C and a mixing speed of 1270 rpm was found to be the optimum values of
            mixing variables (Shaffie et al. 2018)[8]. Later studies were conducted with a combination of additives in
            bitumen. The optimum content of crumb rubber-HDPE mixture in bitumen was 8% while it was 6% for crumb
            rubber-LDPE mixture (Ghorpade and Desai 2018)[7].</p>

        <p>Strength of the aggregate is measured in terms of the aggregate crushing value. Sample of aggregates passing
            through 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on 10 mm IS sieve were selected and filled into the measuring cylinder
            in three layers giving 25 blows for each layer. The sample was tested for crushing in the compression
            testing machine at the rate of 4 tonnes per minute for 10 minutes. The crushed sample was then sieved
            through 2.36 mm IS sieve.</p>

        <p>The particle shape is determined in terms of flakiness and elongation index. The aggregates were sieved
            through IS sieves of sizes 20 mm, 16 mm, 12.5 mm, 10 mm and 6.3 mm. A certain amount of fraction retained on
            each of the sieves were taken and passed through the length gauge and thickness gauge. The aggregates
            passing through the thickness gauge were taken as flaky and those retained on the length gauge were taken as
            elongated. According to the MORTH specifications shape of aggregates is determined using combined elongation
            and flakiness index. Flakiness Index test was carried out in the selected sample of aggregates. The flaky
            particles passing through the respective slots of the thickness gauge were removed and the Elongation Index
            test was carried out in the remaining non-flaky particles and the Elongation Index so obtained was noted as
            EI_c.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Combined elongation and flakiness index = FI +EI_c (3.3)
                In addition the angularity of aggregates were also tested. Angularity of aggregates is defined as the
                absence of roundness which is of importance as it affects the interlocking properties of the compacted
                aggregate layer and the ease of handling the aggregate binder mixture. The test sample passing through
                10mm IS sieve and retained on 6.3mm IS sieve were selected for the test and filled in the cylinder of 3
                litre capacity in 3 layers giving 100 blows each. The weight of aggregate in cylinder was noted as W g,
                the weight of water filling the cylinder was taken as C g and the specific gravity of aggregate was

        <p>All mix design methods use density and voids to determine basic HMA physical characteristics. Two different
            measures of densities are typically taken:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bulk specific gravity (Gmb).</li>
            <li>Theoretical maximum specific gravity (TMD, Gmm).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These densities are then used to calculate the volumetric parameters of the HMA. Measured void expressions
            are usually:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Voids in the total mix (VIM)</li>
            <li>Voids in the mineral aggregate (VMA)</li>

        <p>The Marshall stability and flow test provides the performance prediction measure for the Marshall mix design
            method. The stability portion of the test measures the maximum load supported by the test specimen at a
            loading rate of 50.8 mm/minute (2 inches/minute). Basically, the load is increased until it reaches a
            maximum then when the load just begins to decrease, the loading is stopped and the maximum load is recorded.
        </p>

        <p>During the loading, an attached dial gauge measures the specimen’s plastic flow as a result of the loading.
            The flow value is recorded in 0.25 mm (0.01 inch) increments at the same time the maximum load is recorded.
            The apparatus of Marshall stability test is shown in fig.3.1.

        <p>The optimum bitumen binder content is finally selected based on the combined results of Marshall stability
            and flow, density analysis and void analysis. Optimum bitumen binder content can be arrived at in the
            following procedure:</p>

        <p>Plot the following graphs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. density: Density will generally increase with increasing bitumen content,
                reach a maximum, then decrease. Peak density usually occurs at a higher bitumen binder content than peak
                stability.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. Marshall stability: This should follow one of two trends: Stability increases
                with increasing bitumen binder content, reaches a peak, then decreases. or Stability decreases with
                increasing bitumen binder content and does not show a peak. This curve is common for some recycled HMA
                mixtures.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. flow.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. air voids. Percent air voids should decrease with increasing bitumen binder
                content.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. VMA. Percent VMA should decrease with increasing bitumen binder content,
                reach a minimum, then increase.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. VFB. Percent VFB increases with increasing bitumen binder content.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Determine the bitumen binder content that corresponds to the specifications median air void content
            (typically this is 3-5 percent). This is the optimum bitumen binder content.</p>

        <p>Determine properties at this optimum bitumen binder content by referring to the plots. Compare each of these
            values against specification values and if all are within specification, then the preceding optimum bitumen
            binder content is satisfactory.</p>

        <p>The latex-bitumen blends were prepared by heating the bitumen to a pouring consistency in a pan at 135 to

            6%, 8% and 9%. The blends were then tested for penetration, softening point, specific gravity and ductility.
            The percentage of latex by weight of bitumen in the latex-bitumen blend which yield better results in these
            tests were fixed to be the optimum value. Further the results obtained were compared to the test results for
            pure bitumen.</p>

            error method</p>

        <p><img src="assets/bcgrading.png" alt="Marshall mix"></p>

        <p>The proportion of aggregates were fixed using the following equations (1) and (2).
            P = Aa + Bb + Cc … (1)
            a + b + c + …= 1.00 (2)
            About 1200g of this batched aggregate was heated to 175 to 190°C. The bitumen was heated in parallel to a
            pouring temperature of 140°C to which measured amount of latex was added. The blend was then stirred
            thoroughly, poured onto the heated aggregate and evenly mixed as shown in fig. 2. The mix is placed in a
            preheated mould and compacted by a rammer with 75 blows on either side. The bitumen content was varied in
            the next trial by +0.5% and the above procedure was repeated from 5.0% to 7.0% of total mixture weight.
            Three specimens were prepared for each latex-bitumen content. Four levels of latex content were investigated
            in this study, at 0%, 2%, 4% and 6% latex by weight of bitumen respectively. The Marshall stability and flow
            value of the modified mixes were then studied in comparison with those made with pure bitumen using Marshall
            apparatus. Further density and void calculations were also conducted.</p>

        <p>These test results were analysed graphically for Marshall stability, flow value bulk specific gravity and
            percentage air voids in order to compare the variation in properties of latex modified mix with that of pure
            bituminous mix. For this, graphs were plotted with Marshall stability, flow value, bulk specific gravity and
            percentage air voids against binder content as shown in fig. 3.to 7.</p>

        </p>

        <p>It was observed that the peak values of Marshall stability, bulk specific gravity and the minimum value of
            Marshall flow was around 6 to 6.5% of binder content for specimen with pure bitumen and was around 5 to 6%
            of binder content for specimens with 8% latex content. On an average, the optimum binder content for pure
            bitumen specimens was fixed as 6.14% and that of 8% latex-bitumen blend was 5.55%. For the purpose of study,
            specimens with 7% latex-bitumen blend were also prepared for different binder contents and all the above
            parameters were studied. But the results obtained were poor compared to the specimens of 8% latex-bitumen
            blend. Hence, a binder content of 5.55% with 8% latex in bitumen was found to the best mix.</p>

        <p>In this study, the performance of latex DRC60 modified bituminous concrete wearing course was studied. The
            properties of base materials were first studied and then the optimum content of latex DRC60 to be added to
            modify the bitumen was estimated, which was found to be 8% by weight of bitumen. The bituminous concrete mix
            proportioning was done and the Marshall specimens were prepared with 0% and 8% latex-bitumen blends for a
            binder content of 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 and 7%. On testing the specimens it was found that the addition of latex
            DRC60 could improve the strength of the mix as well as reduce the deformations. Each of the preliminary
            tests conducted to determine the properties of aggregates and bitumen suggests their suitability to be used
            in the wearing course of pavement. The tests conducted on bitumen modified with 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8% latex
            revealed that</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The penetration of bitumen decreases, while the softening point, ductility and specific gravity
                increases with increase in latex content.</li>
            <li>The optimum values for the tests were obtained for 8% latex in bitumen. A trial blend of 9% latex was
                prepared and discarded since the workability offered was poor.</li>
            <li>The lower penetration value and higher ductility and softening point suggested that the blend could be
                used in warmer regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With this 8% latex modified bitumen, mix proportioning was done which satisfied the MORTH specifications. The
            samples with pure bitumen and modified bitumen were prepared, tested and compared for Marshall stability and
            flow value as well as for density and void analysis which showed that</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The peak of Marshall stability and bulk specific gravity and the valley of Marshall flow value were
                obtained at lower binder contents for samples of modified bitumen compared to samples of pure bitumen.
            </li>
            <li>The optimum binder content for modified bituminous mix was thus found to be 5.55% while it was 6.14% for
                pure bituminous mix.</li>
            <li>This suggested that the desired strength and durability is obtained with modified bituminous mix and
                that it can reduce about 16% of bitumen in the mix compared to pure bituminous mix.</li>
            <li>Trial mix specimens prepared for 7% latex in bitumen was discarded as it obtained poor results. Thus, a
                bituminous mix with 8% latex by weight of bitumen at 5.55% binder content was fixed to be the optimum
                mix.</li>
        </ul>
