# ANALYSIS TO STUDY CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR AND PREFERENCES IN THE TEXTILE RETAIL MARKET OF INDIAN ADULTS (AGE 18 TO 40 YEARS)

## INTRODUCTION
### GENERAL BACKGROUND
Clothes are one of the major necessities of humans. The use of animal skin and leaves as clothing materials to now using materials, humans have a long history with textiles. There is evidence suggested that the use of apparels is started even before 30,000 BC. At the beginning, it was just as protective layer that helps humans from harsh weather and other insects and bugs. Even though that remains unchanged, now a days clothes are more like a fashion statement. It shows what is your background, what are you celebrating, etc. People will easily judge you with your looks, it is the door to one’s identity. The importance of textile industry is increasing day by day.
Textile has a major contribution to India’s trade history. India is very famous for its cotton, silk, wool, and other textile materials all around the world. Not just the raw materials, India has its craftsmanship which attracts a lot of people. Banarasi to Kanjeevaram and Pochampally to Muga silk show the rich textile culture of India. The historic silk route connecting Europe and Asia shows the influence of the textile industry in the olden period. According to invest India government site [11], 2.3% of Indian GDP comes from textile industry and it is the second largest employment producer after agriculture. This shows the significance of textile industry in India.

### IMPORTANCE OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY
The textile business is very profitable in India. With the increase in Indian cultural influence all over the world the textile of India has a great demand globally. As the most populated country in the world, the textile demand in India is very high. India is one of the largest producers as well as the consumers of cotton in the whole world. It is estimated that textile industry directly giving employment to close to 45 Million people and indirectly through other related ways to almost 100 million people. India is the second largest producer of silk and 95 percent of world’s hand-woven fabric is from India. In the global trade of textile and apparels India hold around 4%. India is aiming to increase the export to around 100 Billion by 2030. So, it will create a lot of job opportunities and it will boost the economy.
The textile industry of India not only have importance in foreign countries but also it is very important within the country. 2% countries GDP comes from domestic textile only. The importance of technical textile is increasing. By industrial revolution textile is one of the first industries that got mechanised. Because it is a very important but at the same time labour and time-consuming industry. In the modern times more advanced manufacturing facilities are available, the consumers are expecting better quality, less time-consuming textile fabric as well. In the technical textile, India only has 5th position in the world. In this area India has a lot of potential. India’s textile industry is majorly focused on cotton and that is important. But it needs to expand to other fabrics as well to beat other countries like China in global trade of textiles.

### NEED OF CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS
Every business's success depends upon how it is serving its consumers, and how they are satisfying customers’ demands. Guessing what is in customers' minds is a tricky thing to do. For that proper studies need to be conducted and understand the factors that will lead to a positive customer experience and that will further create loyal customer groups. Loyal customers are creating more profits for every business. In the present-day scenario, people are making online as well as offline textile purchases. There are a lot of factors affecting the choice of purchase. It changes with the demographic features of the population. In the total GDP contribution by textile industry, majority comes from India itself. The main purchasers are the young adults who have purchasing power and highly influenced by the global fashion.
So, it is very important to study the people who plays the key role in this industry as consumers. The analysis is intended to study the numerous factors that affect the customer's behaviour and its correlation with demographic features by taking a sample population from all over India through a questionnaire and analysing the responses.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
### OBJECTIVES
Consumer analysis will provide great insight into consumer behaviour and preferences, which will help to improve businesses. By studying the demographic features and changes in preferences that depend on demographic features will help to customize each service to each group based on the requirements. The main objectives of this study are as follows:
- To study the demographic features of the consumers.
- To study the preferences of consumers in terms of mode of purchase, material of purchase, customization, type of apparels and its correlation with the demographic features of consumers.
- To study the factors affecting textile purchasing patterns and behaviour of the consumers.
- To analyse the consumer behaviour and preferences data, visualise it and derive meaningful insights from it.
- To study the brand preferences of the customers and factors affecting the preferences.

## LITERATURE REVIEW
### CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS OF TEXTILE RETAILERS IN TAMIL NADU
Research on consumer preference of textile retailers has been conducted by many researchers. Umamaheswari et al. [1] studied the consumer preference for textile retail outlets with more emphasis on selected outlets in Coimbatore city. After economic liberalisation in 1991, Indian textile industry got a great boost. Industry is divided into different other industries like cotton, silk, wool, handcrafted, jute, etc. By exporting into foreign markets, the industry has expanded a lot. The textile industry of India is one of the leading textile industries in the world. The demand for clothes is increasing and factors affecting consumer behaviour are an important thing to study. Umamaheswari et al. [1] collected data from one hundred respondents through a questionnaire about a few outlets from Coimbatore which have branches all over Tamil Nadu. Most responders where males, mostly below 20, unmarried and of undergraduate education. The results were analysed, and some major conclusions were reached. The varieties of collection were the major factor influenced and males were the major purchasers. Discounts given by the outlets also have a greater impact in choosing that retail outlet. Majority of the responders are not visiting same outlet all the time, considering the variety of outfits available in different stores. Advertisements were the major source of awareness and trained and well-behaved staff also had an impact on customers' purchases.
Dr. S. Parimala [2] researched consumer satisfaction towards branded retail outlets in Tirupur. Indian textile industry achieved a record high growth phase and is estimated to grow further. Textile industry is very important in India’s exports, since it is contributing to 30% of it. National textile mission is aiming to make India as the global leader in textile industry. PLI schemes are providing to boost the industry after post covid decline. Not just the textile raw materials of India have reach in global level, the craftmanship and fashion designers of India also getting the name in the global level. As Tirupur is one of the main textile manufacturing hubs of India mainly for knit wears, Its retail sector is also very developed. Two hundred customers were surveyed and by using different analytical tools the results were obtained. Primary data is collected through field survey. And the secondary data is collected through journals, websites etc. Chi-square, weighted score ranking etc are used to analyse the collected data. Accuracy is dependent of responder’s point of view. Majority of the responders were males, married and mostly in between 20 and 30. New trends, reasonable price, quality of the product were the main factors that affected choosing an outlet. The problems faced was high price, quality impairment etc. Reliance trends were the first preference of the consumers which provided quality product in affordable cost. The results suggested that the customers were cheerful because of the service retail stores provided.

### CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR OF APPAREL INDUSTRY IN DELHI
The work done by Dr. Sandeep Kumar [3] on consumer behaviour in the apparel industry in Delhi was reviewed. This research was conducted to study the socio-economic features of customers who prefer branded products and the factors affecting their decision. People prefer branded apparels as they are trendy, shows prestige, durable and high standard. By make in India and Silk India policies, India will be a global fashion centre soon. Retailers are providing values to both producers and consumers by providing different services to both the parties. Random sample of 200 people were taken for studies which mostly consists of females. The age is in the younger side and income is more than 2.4 lakh for most of the responders. The responders who have preference towards branded clothes also have preference to specific stores as well. In effective after sale services were one of the main concerns. The purchasing pattern of relatives and friends also have an impact in the consumer behaviour of an individual. The results of the study suggested that the customers have brand awareness. The factors affecting purchase are durability, diversity in the collection, high standards, etc. In the study, it was also clear that purchasing behaviour also depends on the demographics of the population.

### ONLINE APPAREL PURCHASE BEHAVIOUR OF CONSUMERS
Dr. Garima Mathur et al. [4] studied the online apparel purchase behaviour of consumers in Indore City. Online shopping become the one of the major motivations to use internet now a days. People have access to wide range of products and services. The factors affecting conventional instore purchasing cannot be applied to the online purchasing behaviour. Both need separate analysis and tailored services to meet the customers' needs. This can be also applied to segment customers as well. The study suggests that online shopping become the alternative to instore because of its security, convenience and product quality. Another bigger advantage of online shopping is that it will provide customized shopping experience to its customers with lesser transactional cost. And, when retail business moves to online which will create a lot of new job opportunities. 300 consumers were taken from various parts of Indore for the survey and asked a set of structured questions. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics tools and chi-square test. Majority of the responders were male and most of the responders were above 35. The monthly income of most of the responders in the range 20000-40000 and most of them were postgraduates. The study gave great insights into the spending behaviour of consumers, choice of preferences on various collections, and website preferences for shopping. The study suggests that with the rise of social media platforms, brands must focus on marketing through social media. Study also suggested that people were not willing to pay more than 5000 in online for apparel purchase considering online security and high price. The study has given a lot of great insights for retailers for their future strategies.
Vinith Kumar Nair et al. [6] studied the consumer behaviour in men’s fashion apparel. 500 young males were part of the study and it suggested to select one apparel quality, comfort and design were important. The study shows people prefer online shopping than instore. Social media ads and TV ads has significant influence in the purchases of the individuals. The study also shows that age and income have a greater influence in the purchasing frequency of the consumer.

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
### RESEARCH HYPOTHESES 
As part of this study, the features of textile purchase and its dependency towards various demographic features of the consumers were planned to study using chi-square test with the help of python. Following are the features taken to test dependency and the corresponding hypothesis formulated.
Customer can have preference towards customization of the clothes, It can be readymade or custom tailored. To study how age is associated with customization preference, hypothesis is created.
H0: There is no significant association between age and customization preference.
H1: There is significant association between age and customization preference.
Customer can have preference towards mode of purchasing clothes, It can be online or conventional instore mode. To study how gender is associated with mode preference, hypothesis is created.
H0: There is no significant association between gender and mode preference.
H1: There is significant association between gender and mode preference.
Annual income of an individual has direct relationship with purchasing power of that person. But whether it have a positive or negative significance towards that that person’s spending on textile purchase need to determine. To study how income is associated with spending on textile purchase, hypothesis is created. Hypothesis were also created to determine the association of education and occupation of the customer on their average annual spending for textile purchase.
H0: There is no significant association between income and spending on textile purchase.
H1: There is significant association between income and spending on textile purchase.
H0: There is no significant association between education and spending on textile purchase.

Locality is the demographic features shows what type of society a consumer is located in. Different types of cities to villages, people are living in different areas. How locality is influencing the fashion choice and mode of purchasing, hypothesis is created.
H0: There is no significant association between locality type and mode preference.
H1: There is significant association between locality type and mode preference.
H0: There is no significant association between locality type and fashion choice.
H1: There is significant association between locality type and fashion choice.

### RESEARCH PLAN
A descriptive study is conducted to analyse the behaviour and preferences of textile customers in India in the age group 18-40 (adults). Customers are the key to the success of every industry. What are customers’ wants and needs, What are the factors affecting their purchasing behaviour, etc. need to be studied thoroughly. The factors affecting will change rapidly with time. So, studies of consumer behaviour should be conducted constantly to provide the best service possible and to expand the business to gain more customers that will be loyal to the brand. Loyalty customers create more purchasing opportunity for a business than random purchases. To keep the customers, customer behaviour and preferences need to thoroughly analyse, and strategies need to be created to stay competitive in market. Customer behaviour analysis is developed as a psychological analysis to create better business plans. With the help of machine learning and data analysis tools, customer behaviour can be easily analysed and visually appealing and easily understanding results can be formulated.
Primary data is collected through the questionnaire in the form of Google Forms and reached out to people through social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. The responses are collected from respondents from various genders, ages, educational qualifications, occupations, income groups, different zones of India, etc. Data regarding their preferences on the mode of purchase, the material of purchase, influencing factors, and brand awareness details are collected.
Data collected is cleaned and analysed with the help of R, Power BI, Excel and Tableau. The dependency of various categorical variables was studied using chi-square test using python. Hypothesis were created for testing the association between these categorical variables that is part of purchasing behaviour and demographic variables of the customer. Correlation matrices were created and analysed for various factors affecting customer preferences. Various data visualizations and dashboards are created using python, tableau and power BI.

### SAMPLING PLAN
Primary data is collected through questionnaires in the google form. Customers were randomly selected and send out in social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram and LinkedIn. Customers were asked to provide data regarding demographic features such as age, income, gender, locality, etc. These features do not include any personal identifiable information. This was to give customers more comfort in the question and to feel safe and secure to answer questions. Customers were asked about the preferences regarding mode, customization, materials, fashion etc. Brand preferences related questions were also asked to make meaningful insights.
Secondary data is collected through journals, government sites and other websites. The data collected through questionnaires is planned to be clean and then samples were planning to collect through random sampling. Simple random sampling technique is planning to adopt for this research.


### RESEARCH PROCEDURE
Once data is collected, it is planned to clean and check for outliers. Outliers were planning to remove and sample dataset will be collected afterwards. The first process to do after this is to check the association of demographic features to the purchasing features. Categorical variables will be selected for this, and chi-square test will be performed in python. Chi square test is a statistical hypothesis testing tool used to test the dependency of two categorical variables. It is a recommended hypothesis testing tool when sample size is more than fifty. Hypothesis is created to test using chi-square test. To test chi square in python, the following procedure is followed. Define the relationship between the categorical variables and corresponding hypothesis were created. Created contingency table using panda library with the function pd.crosstab. With the help of scipy.stats library and its chi2_contigency function chi square, p, degree of freedom was calculated and taking significance level alpha as 0.05, p value and alpha were compared to accept or reject null hypothesis.
Different factors affecting online and instore purchase were planning to collect from the customers. It is planning to rank the factors and study the correlation between each is determined by correlation matrix and heatmap. Correlation matrix will only work in data with numerical values. After the data is cleaned and sampling is done, data set is created using python library called pandas. From the whole data subset data is created for online factors and instore factors and corresponding correlations matrices were planning to create. With the help of matplotlib plot is created and with the help of seaborn library in python heatmap is created to visualize the correlations between factor variables.
The customers were asked to describe in one word or one phrase their purchasing behaviour. The data were collected is cleaned and string is created and with the help of word cloud library in python word cloud is created and plotted using matplotlib.
Other data visualization charts and dashboards are planning to create with the various preferences and factors data collected with the help of Tableau and Power BI.

#### Aggregate Impact Value
The aggregate impact value should not be more than 30 % to be used in wearing course as per the MORTH specifications. The results of aggregate impact test are as shown in Table 4.2
Table 4.2 Test results of aggregate impact test
![table 4.2](/assets/table4.2.png)
The tested sample therefore falls within the desired limit. Moreover, it is satisfactory for road surfacing.

#### Flakiness Index	
As per the IRC recommendations, the maximum limit of flakiness index of aggregates to be used in surface course is 25%. The results of the test are as shown in Table 4.3.
Table 4.3 Test results of flakiness index test
![table 4.3](/assets/table4.3.png)
The obtained flakiness index lies within the permissible limits. Hence the aggregates are suitable for surface dressing.

#### Elongation Index
The permissible limit of elongation index of aggregate is 25%. The recorded observations of elongation test is shown in Table 4.4. The elongation index obtained is 23.722 % which is within the desired limits.
Table 4.4 Test results of elongation index test
![table 4.4](/assets/table4.4.png)

#### Combined Flakiness and Elongation Index
As per the MORTH specifications, combined flakiness and elongation index must be less than 30%. The obtained results of the test are as shown in Table 4.5, which shows the combined flakiness and elongation index as 29.139% and it is less than the permissible limits.
Table 4.5 Test results of combined elongation and flakiness index test
![table 4.5](/assets/table4.5.png)

#### Specific Gravity of Coarse Aggregates
Table 4.6 shows the observations of the test for specific gravity on coarse aggregates. The specific gravity of aggregates used in road construction usually ranges from 2.5 to 3 with an average of 2.68. The obtained value of 2.625 lies within the desirable limits.
Table 4.6 Test results of specific gravity of coarse aggregates
![table 4.6](/assets/table4.6.png)

#### Specific Gravity of Fine Aggregates
Specific gravity of fine aggregates were determined using pycnometer method. The obtained specific gravity lies within the range of 2.5 to 3. The observations are shown in table 4.7.
Table 4.7 Test results of specific gravity of fine aggregate
![table 4.7](/assets/table4.7.png)

#### Angularity of Aggregates
The angularity number of aggregates generally ranges from 0 for highly rounded particles to about 11 for freshly crushed angular aggregates. The test
results shown in Table 4.8 gives an angularity number of 8, which suggests that the aggregates are nearly angular.
Table 4.8 Test results of angularity of aggregates
![table 4.8](/assets/table4.8.png)

#### Gradation and Size of Aggregates
Table 4.9 shows the test results obtained in the sieve analysis of aggregates. The gradation curve was then plotted as shown in Fig 4.1 which was found to be an S shaped curve. This indicates that the aggregates are well graded.
Table 4.9 Test results of sieve analysis of aggregates

![Fig 4.1](/assets/fig4.1.png)

### RESULTS OF BITUMEN TESTING
A sample of bitumen was taken and the following observations were recorded after different tests. 
#### Penetration Test on Bitumen
The penetration value of bitumen was determined using a penetrometer and was found to be 65. Hence it belongs to the penetration grade 60/70.

#### Softening Point Test on Bitumen
The obtained softening point temperature of bitumen was found to be 64.1°C. Hence the bitumen can be used at higher temperatures.

#### Specific Gravity of Bitumen
Specific gravity of pure bitumen is expected to be in the range of 0.97 to 1.1. The specific gravity obtained as shown in Table 4.10 is 1.06, which is within this limit.
Table 4.10 Test results of specific gravity of bitumen
![table 4.10](/assets/table4.10.png)

#### Ductility Test on Bitumen
The ductility value obtained for the bitumen is 65 cm as shown in table 4.11. Hence the bitumen can be used at higher traffic loads and it does not get cracked easily.
Table 4.11 Test results of ductility test on bitumen
![table 4.11](/assets/table4.11.png)

### Tests on Latex-Bitumen Blend
The tests conducted on the latex-bitumen blend obtained the following results shown in TABLE

![Latex bitumen](/assets/latexbitumen.png)

It can be inferred from the table that for the blend with 8% latex by weight of bitumen, all the properties were improved compared to the base bitumen. Further a trial blend of 9% latex by weight of bitumen was also prepared for testing. However, this blend prepared resulted in a thick blend with reduced workability. Increasing the percentage of latex in bitumen gradually reduced the workability. Hence, the blend with 9% of latex content was discarded and further tests were not conducted on the same. Thus 8% of latex by weight of bitumen was selected to be the optimum latex content in the modified blend.

### Results of Mix Proportioning
Bituminous concrete mix design was carried out for both the base bitumen and the bitumen modified with an optimum latex content of 8%. The aggregates were proportioned and batched as shown in TABLE V and VI.

![mix proportion](/assets/mixpropotion.png)
![batch](/assets/batch.png)

The proportioning was in agreement with the MORTH specification. Hence, it was fixed that for the preparation of Marshall mix specimens, out of a total of 1200g aggregates, about 62% will be Sample A, 12% will be Sample B and 26% will be Sample C. 

The weight of materials to be selected for the bituminous mixes were as shown in TABLE VII and VIII. Three samples were prepared for various binder contents from 5% to 7% and were then tested in the Marshall apparatus for stability and flow value. Further, density and void calculations were done. The results thus obtained for the mixes with base bitumen and modified bitumen were then compared to determine the optimum binder content for the modified mix.

![mix pro](/assets/mixpro.png)

### Results of Tests on Bituminous Concrete Mixes
The maximum load which each of the specimen of different binder content at 0% and 8% latex-bitumen blend could withstand were determined along with the deformation occurred at that time. The theoretical specific gravity (Gt) and bulk specific gravity (Gm) for the specimens were calculated. These values were then used to calculate the volumetric parameters of specimens like percentage of air voids (Vv) and percentage volume of bitumen (Vb). The results obtained are as shown in TABLE IX and X below.

![concrete](/assets/concrete.png)

These test results were analysed graphically for Marshall stability, flow value bulk specific gravity and percentage air voids in order to compare the variation in properties of latex modified mix with that of pure bituminous mix. For this, graphs were plotted with Marshall stability, flow value, bulk specific gravity and percentage air voids against binder content as shown in fig. 3.to 7.

![graph1](/assets/graph1.png)
![graph2](/assets/graph2.png)
![graph3](/assets/graph3.png)

It was observed that the peak values of Marshall stability, bulk specific gravity and the minimum value of Marshall flow was around 6 to 6.5% of binder content for specimen with pure bitumen and was around 5 to 6% of binder content for specimens with 8% latex content. On an average, the optimum binder content for pure bitumen specimens was fixed as 6.14% and that of 8% latex-bitumen blend was 5.55%. For the purpose of study, specimens with 7% latex-bitumen blend were also prepared for different binder contents and all the above parameters were studied. But the results obtained were poor compared to the specimens of 8% latex-bitumen blend. Hence, a binder content of 5.55% with 8% latex in bitumen was found to the best mix.

## CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the performance of latex DRC60 modified bituminous concrete wearing course was studied. The properties of base materials were first studied and then the optimum content of latex DRC60 to be added to modify the bitumen was estimated, which was found to be 8% by weight of bitumen. The bituminous concrete mix proportioning was done and the Marshall specimens were prepared with 0% and 8% latex-bitumen blends for a binder content of 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 and 7%. On testing the specimens it was found that the addition of latex DRC60 could improve the strength of the mix as well as reduce the deformations. Each of the preliminary tests conducted to determine the properties of aggregates and bitumen suggests their suitability to be used in the wearing course of pavement. The tests conducted on bitumen modified with 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8% latex revealed that
- The penetration of bitumen decreases, while the softening point, ductility and specific gravity increases with increase in latex content.
- The optimum values for the tests were obtained for 8% latex in bitumen. A trial blend of 9% latex was prepared and discarded since the workability offered was poor.
- The lower penetration value and higher ductility and softening point suggested that the blend could be used in warmer regions.

With this 8% latex modified bitumen, mix proportioning was done which satisfied the MORTH specifications. The samples with pure bitumen and modified bitumen were prepared, tested and compared for Marshall stability and flow value as well as for density and void analysis which showed that
- The peak of Marshall stability and bulk specific gravity and the valley of Marshall flow value were obtained at lower binder contents for samples of modified bitumen compared to samples of pure bitumen.
- The optimum binder content for modified bituminous mix was thus found to be 5.55% while it was 6.14% for pure bituminous mix.
- This suggested that the desired strength and durability is obtained with modified bituminous mix and that it can reduce about 16% of bitumen in the mix compared to pure bituminous mix.
- Trial mix specimens prepared for 7% latex in bitumen was discarded as it obtained poor results. Thus, a bituminous mix with 8% latex by weight of bitumen at 5.55% binder content was fixed to be the optimum mix.
