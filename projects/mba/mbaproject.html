            CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR AND PREFERENCES IN THE TEXTILE RETAIL MARKET OF INDIAN ADULTS (AGE 18 TO 40 YEARS)</h1>

        <h2 id="chapter">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">GENERAL BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p>Clothes are one of the major necessities of humans. The use of animal skin and leaves as clothing materials
            to now using materials, humans have a long history with textiles. There is evidence suggested that the use
            of apparels is started even before 30,000 BC. At the beginning, it was just as protective layer that helps
            humans from harsh weather and other insects and bugs. Even though that remains unchanged, now a days clothes
            are more like a fashion statement. It shows what is your background, what are you celebrating, etc. People
            will easily judge you with your looks, it is the door to one’s identity. The importance of textile industry
            is increasing day by day.
            Textile has a major contribution to India’s trade history. India is very famous for its cotton, silk, wool,
            and other textile materials all around the world. Not just the raw materials, India has its craftsmanship
            which attracts a lot of people. Banarasi to Kanjeevaram and Pochampally to Muga silk show the rich textile
            culture of India. The historic silk route connecting Europe and Asia shows the influence of the textile
            industry in the olden period. According to invest India government site [11], 2.3% of Indian GDP comes from
            textile industry and it is the second largest employment producer after agriculture. This shows the
            significance of textile industry in India.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">IMPORTANCE OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY</h3>
        <p>The textile business is very profitable in India. With the increase in Indian cultural influence all over the
            world the textile of India has a great demand globally. As the most populated country in the world, the
            textile demand in India is very high. India is one of the largest producers as well as the consumers of
            cotton in the whole world. It is estimated that textile industry directly giving employment to close to 45
            Million people and indirectly through other related ways to almost 100 million people. India is the second
            largest producer of silk and 95 percent of world’s hand-woven fabric is from India. In the global trade of
            textile and apparels India hold around 4%. India is aiming to increase the export to around 100 Billion by
            2030. So, it will create a lot of job opportunities and it will boost the economy.<br>
            The textile industry of India not only have importance in foreign countries but also it is very important
            within the country. 2% countries GDP comes from domestic textile only. The importance of technical textile
            is increasing. By industrial revolution textile is one of the first industries that got mechanised. Because
            it is a very important but at the same time labour and time-consuming industry. In the modern times more
            advanced manufacturing facilities are available, the consumers are expecting better quality, less
            time-consuming textile fabric as well. In the technical textile, India only has 5th position in the world.
            In this area India has a lot of potential. India’s textile industry is majorly focused on cotton and that is
            important. But it needs to expand to other fabrics as well to beat other countries like China in global
            trade of textiles.

            the present-day scenario, people are making online as well as offline textile purchases. There are a lot of
            factors affecting the choice of purchase. It changes with the demographic features of the population. In the
            total GDP contribution by textile industry, majority comes from India itself. The main purchasers are the
            young adults who have purchasing power and highly influenced by the global fashion.<br>
            So, it is very important to study the people who plays the key role in this industry as consumers. The
            analysis is intended to study the numerous factors that affect the customer's behaviour and its correlation
            with demographic features by taking a sample population from all over India through a questionnaire and
            analysing the responses.

        <h2 id="chapter">LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS OF TEXTILE RETAILERS IN TAMIL NADU</h3>
        <p>Research on consumer preference of textile retailers has been conducted by many researchers. Umamaheswari et
            al. [1] studied the consumer preference for textile retail outlets with more emphasis on selected outlets in
            Coimbatore city. After economic liberalisation in 1991, Indian textile industry got a great boost. Industry
            is divided into different other industries like cotton, silk, wool, handcrafted, jute, etc. By exporting
            into foreign markets, the industry has expanded a lot. The textile industry of India is one of the leading
            textile industries in the world. The demand for clothes is increasing and factors affecting consumer
            behaviour are an important thing to study. Umamaheswari et al. [1] collected data from one hundred
            respondents through a questionnaire about a few outlets from Coimbatore which have branches all over Tamil
            Nadu. Most responders where males, mostly below 20, unmarried and of undergraduate education. The results
            were analysed, and some major conclusions were reached. The varieties of collection were the major factor
            influenced and males were the major purchasers. Discounts given by the outlets also have a greater impact in
            choosing that retail outlet. Majority of the responders are not visiting same outlet all the time,
            considering the variety of outfits available in different stores. Advertisements were the major source of
            awareness and trained and well-behaved staff also had an impact on customers' purchases.<br>
            Dr. S. Parimala [2] researched consumer satisfaction towards branded retail outlets in Tirupur. Indian
            textile industry achieved a record high growth phase and is estimated to grow further. Textile industry is
            very important in India’s exports, since it is contributing to 30% of it. National textile mission is aiming
            to make India as the global leader in textile industry. PLI schemes are providing to boost the industry
            after post covid decline. Not just the textile raw materials of India have reach in global level, the
            craftmanship and fashion designers of India also getting the name in the global level. As Tirupur is one of
            the main textile manufacturing hubs of India mainly for knit wears, Its retail sector is also very
            developed. Two hundred customers were surveyed and by using different analytical tools the results were
            obtained. Primary data is collected through field survey. And the secondary data is collected through
            journals, websites etc. Chi-square, weighted score ranking etc are used to analyse the collected data.
            Accuracy is dependent of responder’s point of view. Majority of the responders were males, married and
            mostly in between 20 and 30. New trends, reasonable price, quality of the product were the main factors that
            affected choosing an outlet. The problems faced was high price, quality impairment etc. Reliance trends were
            the first preference of the consumers which provided quality product in affordable cost. The results
            suggested that the customers were cheerful because of the service retail stores provided.</p>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR OF APPAREL INDUSTRY IN DELHI</h3>
        <p>The work done by Dr. Sandeep Kumar [3] on consumer behaviour in the apparel industry in Delhi was reviewed.
            This research was conducted to study the socio-economic features of customers who prefer branded products
            and the factors affecting their decision. People prefer branded apparels as they are trendy, shows prestige,
            durable and high standard. By make in India and Silk India policies, India will be a global fashion centre
            soon. Retailers are providing values to both producers and consumers by providing different services to both
            the parties. Random sample of 200 people were taken for studies which mostly consists of females. The age is
            in the younger side and income is more than 2.4 lakh for most of the responders. The responders who have
            preference towards branded clothes also have preference to specific stores as well. In effective after sale
            services were one of the main concerns. The purchasing pattern of relatives and friends also have an impact
            in the consumer behaviour of an individual. The results of the study suggested that the customers have brand
            awareness. The factors affecting purchase are durability, diversity in the collection, high standards, etc.
            In the study, it was also clear that purchasing behaviour also depends on the demographics of the
            population.</p>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">ONLINE APPAREL PURCHASE BEHAVIOUR OF CONSUMERS</h3>
        <p>Dr. Garima Mathur et al. [4] studied the online apparel purchase behaviour of consumers in Indore City.
            Online shopping become the one of the major motivations to use internet now a days. People have access to
            wide range of products and services. The factors affecting conventional instore purchasing cannot be applied
            to the online purchasing behaviour. Both need separate analysis and tailored services to meet the customers'
            needs. This can be also applied to segment customers as well. The study suggests that online shopping become
            the alternative to instore because of its security, convenience and product quality. Another bigger
            advantage of online shopping is that it will provide customized shopping experience to its customers with
            lesser transactional cost. And, when retail business moves to online which will create a lot of new job
            opportunities. 300 consumers were taken from various parts of Indore for the survey and asked a set of
            structured questions. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics tools and chi-square test. Majority
            of the responders were male and most of the responders were above 35. The monthly income of most of the
            responders in the range 20000-40000 and most of them were postgraduates. The study gave great insights into
            the spending behaviour of consumers, choice of preferences on various collections, and website preferences
            for shopping. The study suggests that with the rise of social media platforms, brands must focus on
            marketing through social media. Study also suggested that people were not willing to pay more than 5000 in
            online for apparel purchase considering online security and high price. The study has given a lot of great
            insights for retailers for their future strategies.
            Vinith Kumar Nair et al. [6] studied the consumer behaviour in men’s fashion apparel. 500 young males were
            part of the study and it suggested to select one apparel quality, comfort and design were important. The
            study shows people prefer online shopping than instore. Social media ads and TV ads has significant
            influence in the purchases of the individuals. The study also shows that age and income have a greater
            influence in the purchasing frequency of the consumer.</p>
        <h2 id="chapter">RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</h2>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</h3>
        <p>As part of this study, the features of textile purchase and its dependency towards various demographic
            features of the consumers were planned to study using chi-square test with the help of python. Following are
            the features taken to test dependency and the corresponding hypothesis formulated.<br>
            Customer can have preference towards customization of the clothes, It can be readymade or custom tailored.
            To study how age is associated with customization preference, hypothesis is created.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between age and customization preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between age and customization preference.<br>
            Customer can have preference towards mode of purchasing clothes, It can be online or conventional instore
            mode. To study how gender is associated with mode preference, hypothesis is created.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between gender and mode preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between gender and mode preference.<br>
            Annual income of an individual has direct relationship with purchasing power of that person. But whether it
            have a positive or negative significance towards that that person’s spending on textile purchase need to
            determine. To study how income is associated with spending on textile purchase, hypothesis is created.
            Hypothesis were also created to determine the association of education and occupation of the customer on
            their average annual spending for textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between income and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between income and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between education and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between education and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between occupation and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between occupation and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            Locality is the demographic features shows what type of society a consumer is located in. Different types of
            cities to villages, people are living in different areas. How locality is influencing the fashion choice and
            mode of purchasing, hypothesis is created.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between locality type and mode preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between locality type and mode preference.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between locality type and fashion choice.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between locality type and fashion choice.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">RESEARCH PLAN</h3>
        <p>
            A descriptive study is conducted to analyse the behaviour and preferences of textile customers in India in
            the age
            group 18-40 (adults). Customers are the key to the success of every industry. What are customers’ wants and
            needs,
            What are the factors affecting their purchasing behaviour, etc. need to be studied thoroughly. The factors
            affecting
            will change rapidly with time. So, studies of consumer behaviour should be conducted constantly to provide
            the best
            service possible and to expand the business to gain more customers that will be loyal to the brand. Loyalty
            customers create more purchasing opportunity for a business than random purchases. To keep the customers,
            customer
            behaviour and preferences need to thoroughly analyse, and strategies need to be created to stay competitive
            in
            market. Customer behaviour analysis is developed as a psychological analysis to create better business
            plans. With
            the help of machine learning and data analysis tools, customer behaviour can be easily analysed and visually
            appealing and easily understanding results can be formulated.<br>
            Primary data is collected through the questionnaire in the form of Google Forms and reached out to people
            through
            social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. The responses are collected from respondents
            from
            various genders, ages, educational qualifications, occupations, income groups, different zones of India,
            etc. Data
            regarding their preferences on the mode of purchase, the material of purchase, influencing factors, and
            brand
            awareness details are collected.<br>
            Data collected is cleaned and analysed with the help of R, Power BI, Excel and Tableau. The dependency of
            various
            categorical variables was studied using chi-square test using python. Hypothesis were created for testing
            the
            association between these categorical variables that is part of purchasing behaviour and demographic
            variables of
            the customer. Correlation matrices were created and analysed for various factors affecting customer
            preferences.
            Various data visualizations and dashboards are created using python, tableau and power BI.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">SAMPLING PLAN</h3>
        <p>Primary data is collected through questionnaires in the google form. Customers were randomly selected and
            send out in social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram and LinkedIn. Customers were asked to provide
            data regarding demographic features such as age, income, gender, locality, etc. These features do not
            include any personal identifiable information. This was to give customers more comfort in the question and
            to feel safe and secure to answer questions. Customers were asked about the preferences regarding mode,
            customization, materials, fashion etc. Brand preferences related questions were also asked to make
            meaningful insights.<br>
            Secondary data is collected through journals, government sites and other websites. The data collected
            through questionnaires is planned to be clean and then samples were planning to collect through random
            sampling. Simple random sampling technique is planning to adopt for this research.</p>
        <h3 id="sub-chapter">RESEARCH PROCEDURE</h3>
        <p>
            Once data is collected, it is planned to clean and check for outliers. Outliers were planning to remove and
            sample dataset will be collected afterwards. The first process to do after this is to check the association
            of demographic features to the purchasing features. Categorical variables will be selected for this, and
            chi-square test will be performed in python. Chi square test is a statistical hypothesis testing tool used
            to test the dependency of two categorical variables. It is a recommended hypothesis testing tool when sample
            size is more than fifty. Hypothesis is created to test using chi-square test. To test chi square in python,
            the following procedure is followed. Define the relationship between the categorical variables and
            corresponding hypothesis were created. Created contingency table using panda library with the function
            pd.crosstab. With the help of scipy.stats library and its chi2_contigency function chi square, p, degree of
            freedom was calculated and taking significance level alpha as 0.05, p value and alpha were compared to
            accept or reject null hypothesis.<br>
            Different factors affecting online and instore purchase were planning to collect from the customers. It is
            planning to rank the factors and study the correlation between each is determined by correlation matrix and
            heatmap. Correlation matrix will only work in data with numerical values. After the data is cleaned and
            sampling is done, data set is created using python library called pandas. From the whole data subset data is
            created for online factors and instore factors and corresponding correlations matrices were planning to
            create. With the help of matplotlib plot is created and with the help of seaborn library in python heatmap
            is created to visualize the correlations between factor variables.<br>
            The customers were asked to describe in one word or one phrase their purchasing behaviour. The data were
            collected is cleaned and string is created and with the help of word cloud library in python word cloud is
            created and plotted using matplotlib.<br>
            Other data visualization charts and dashboards are planning to create with the various preferences and
            factors data collected with the help of Tableau and Power BI.

            include people above 40 and people below 18. These outliers were identified using excel and removed from the
            sample. Some of the questions are marked as optional in google form. Which resulted in null values for
            those. Which were identified and removed for analysis.

        <p>
            Once the data is cleaned the data were summarised and analysed. Total of 75 samples were taken as the sample
            population for the analysis.<br>
            Which represents the Indian young adults in the range of 18 to 40 yrs. in different sectors. The demographic
            distribution of the customers was analysed and tabulated as follows.<br>
            <b>Table 1 – Demographic Distribution Table</b>

        </p>
        The Table-1 shows the distribution of the demographics of the sample population. The main insights derived are
        most of
        the responders were males, which accounting for 57%. The female responders were 43%. Most of the customers in
        the
        analysis are in the age of 26-30 yrs. old accounting for 40% followed by 18-25 with 25%. The least responders
        are in the
        age group 36-40 with 16% of total sample. In the sample most of the responders are living a village with all
        basic
        facilities locality which consists of 20% followed by town with basic facilities which was 17%. The least was
        remote
        tribal village which was 1% of the sample population.<br>
        Most of the responders are in the annual income group 5-10 lakhs consists of 24%. Followed by 3-5 lakhs/ annum
        which
        consists of 21%. The least was the income group above 50 lakhs which was 3%. Under graduates and equivalents
        were a
        major part of the study with 48% of the total sample. Followed by postgraduates and equivalents with 23%. Least
        were
        consumers with PhD which was 1%. While considering the occupation of the responders, professionals where the
        major part
        consists of 48%, followed by unemployed with 13%. The least occupation marked by young adults were agriculture
        which was
        4%.<br>
        Preferences of the users were analysed for the study. Customers have given questions with multiple choices to
        select
        their preference on mode of purchase. Rate at which annually they are spending for textiles in average, what is
        customization preference and what fashion they prefer on an average. The results were tabulated in Table-2 and
        are as
        follows.<br>
        <b>Table 2 – Preferences Distribution Table</b>
        <p>

        </p>
        Most of the responders preferred online mode of shopping than conventional instore mode of shopping. When 51%
        opted for online purchase 49% opted for instore purchase. Annual spending on textile purchase of the responders
        were analysed and the majority comes in the range of 5000-10000 Rs with 29%. Followed by 24% for 10000-20000.
        Customization preference had two options to select from which are custom tailored and readymade. 76% of the
        respondents preferred Readymade were as 24% preferred custom tailor stitched. Fashion preference of the
        customers was analysed. As shows in Table-2 27% were preferred western clothes as their first choice, Followed
        by 25% chose formals.<br>
        Material preference of the customers was analysed. The customers were asked to pick first three choices of their
        preferred materials. Then the data is aggregated and tabulated. Weighted total preference of each material is
        calculated.<br>
        <b>Table 3 – Material Preference Table</b>
        <p>
            <img src="assets/Table3.png" alt="Table 3 – Material Preference Table">
        </p>
        As Table-3 shows, cotton was the most preferred material of choice of Indian young adults. The second most
        preferred material of choice was denim.<br>
        The association of demographic features to the purchasing features were analysed. Categorical variables were
        selected for this, and chi-square test performed in python. To test chi square in python, the following
        procedure is followed. Defined the relationship between the categorical variables and corresponding hypothesis
        were created. Created contingency table using panda library with the function pd.crosstab. With the help of
        scipy.stats library and its chi2_contigency function chi square, p, degree of freedom were calculated and taking
        significance level alpha as 0.05, p value and alpha were compared to accept or reject null hypothesis.<br>
        Different factors affecting online and instore purchase were collected from the customers. It is ranked in the
        order of least affecting to most affecting factors and analysed the correlation between each by creating
        correlation matrix and heatmap. Correlation matrix will only work in data with numerical values. After the data
        is cleaned and sampling is done, data set is created using python library called pandas. From the whole data
        subset data is created for online factors and instore factors and corresponding correlations matrices were
        created. With the help of matplotlib plot is created and with the help of seaborn library in python heatmap is
        created to visualize the correlations between factor variables.<br>
        The customers were asked to describe in one word or one phrase their purchasing behaviour. The data were
        collected is cleaned and string is created and with the help of word cloud library in python word cloud is
        created and plotted using matplotlib and insights were collected.<br>
        Other data visualization charts and dashboards are planning to create with the various preferences and factors
        data collected with the help of Tableau and Power BI. The material preferences, colour preferences and mode
        preferences and the factors affecting that are analysed using tableau and power BI and charts and dashboards
        were created. Then these were analysed to derive information.<br>

        <p>
            Customer can have preference towards customization of the clothes, It can be readymade or custom tailored.
            The hypothesis created to test this is shown below.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between age and customization preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between age and customization preference.
