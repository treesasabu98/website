        <h3 id="general-background">GENERAL BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p>Clothes are one of the major necessities of humans. The use of animal skin and leaves as clothing materials
            to now using materials, humans have a long history with textiles. There is evidence suggested that the use
            of apparels is started even before 30,000 BC. At the beginning, it was just as protective layer that helps
            humans from harsh weather and other insects and bugs. Even though that remains unchanged, now a days clothes
            are more like a fashion statement. It shows what is your background, what are you celebrating, etc. People
            will easily judge you with your looks, it is the door to one’s identity. The importance of textile industry
            is increasing day by day.
            Textile has a major contribution to India’s trade history. India is very famous for its cotton, silk, wool,
            and other textile materials all around the world. Not just the raw materials, India has its craftsmanship
            which attracts a lot of people. Banarasi to Kanjeevaram and Pochampally to Muga silk show the rich textile
            culture of India. The historic silk route connecting Europe and Asia shows the influence of the textile
            industry in the olden period. According to invest India government site [11], 2.3% of Indian GDP comes from
            textile industry and it is the second largest employment producer after agriculture. This shows the
            significance of textile industry in India.
        </p>
        <h3 id="general-background">IMPORTANCE OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY</h3>
        <p>The textile business is very profitable in India. With the increase in Indian cultural influence all over the
            world the textile of India has a great demand globally. As the most populated country in the world, the
            textile demand in India is very high. India is one of the largest producers as well as the consumers of
            cotton in the whole world. It is estimated that textile industry directly giving employment to close to 45
            Million people and indirectly through other related ways to almost 100 million people. India is the second
            largest producer of silk and 95 percent of world’s hand-woven fabric is from India. In the global trade of
            textile and apparels India hold around 4%. India is aiming to increase the export to around 100 Billion by
            2030. So, it will create a lot of job opportunities and it will boost the economy.<br>
            The textile industry of India not only have importance in foreign countries but also it is very important
            within the country. 2% countries GDP comes from domestic textile only. The importance of technical textile
            is increasing. By industrial revolution textile is one of the first industries that got mechanised. Because
            it is a very important but at the same time labour and time-consuming industry. In the modern times more
            advanced manufacturing facilities are available, the consumers are expecting better quality, less
            time-consuming textile fabric as well. In the technical textile, India only has 5th position in the world.
            In this area India has a lot of potential. India’s textile industry is majorly focused on cotton and that is
            important. But it needs to expand to other fabrics as well to beat other countries like China in global
            trade of textiles.

        <h3 id="general-background">NEED OF CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS</h3>
        <p>
            Every business's success depends upon how it is serving its consumers, and how they are satisfying
            customers’ demands. Guessing what is in customers' minds is a tricky thing to do. For that proper studies
            need to be conducted and understand the factors that will lead to a positive customer experience and that
            will further create loyal customer groups. Loyal customers are creating more profits for every business. In
            the present-day scenario, people are making online as well as offline textile purchases. There are a lot of
            factors affecting the choice of purchase. It changes with the demographic features of the population. In the
            total GDP contribution by textile industry, majority comes from India itself. The main purchasers are the
            young adults who have purchasing power and highly influenced by the global fashion.<br>
            So, it is very important to study the people who plays the key role in this industry as consumers. The
            analysis is intended to study the numerous factors that affect the customer's behaviour and its correlation
            with demographic features by taking a sample population from all over India through a questionnaire and
            analysing the responses.

        <h3 id="general-background">CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS OF TEXTILE RETAILERS IN TAMIL NADU</h3>
        <p>Research on consumer preference of textile retailers has been conducted by many researchers. Umamaheswari et
            al. [1] studied the consumer preference for textile retail outlets with more emphasis on selected outlets in
            Coimbatore city. After economic liberalisation in 1991, Indian textile industry got a great boost. Industry
            is divided into different other industries like cotton, silk, wool, handcrafted, jute, etc. By exporting
            into foreign markets, the industry has expanded a lot. The textile industry of India is one of the leading
            textile industries in the world. The demand for clothes is increasing and factors affecting consumer
            behaviour are an important thing to study. Umamaheswari et al. [1] collected data from one hundred
            respondents through a questionnaire about a few outlets from Coimbatore which have branches all over Tamil
            Nadu. Most responders where males, mostly below 20, unmarried and of undergraduate education. The results
            were analysed, and some major conclusions were reached. The varieties of collection were the major factor
            influenced and males were the major purchasers. Discounts given by the outlets also have a greater impact in
            choosing that retail outlet. Majority of the responders are not visiting same outlet all the time,
            considering the variety of outfits available in different stores. Advertisements were the major source of
            awareness and trained and well-behaved staff also had an impact on customers' purchases.<br>
            Dr. S. Parimala [2] researched consumer satisfaction towards branded retail outlets in Tirupur. Indian
            textile industry achieved a record high growth phase and is estimated to grow further. Textile industry is
            very important in India’s exports, since it is contributing to 30% of it. National textile mission is aiming
            to make India as the global leader in textile industry. PLI schemes are providing to boost the industry
            after post covid decline. Not just the textile raw materials of India have reach in global level, the
            craftmanship and fashion designers of India also getting the name in the global level. As Tirupur is one of
            the main textile manufacturing hubs of India mainly for knit wears, Its retail sector is also very
            developed. Two hundred customers were surveyed and by using different analytical tools the results were
            obtained. Primary data is collected through field survey. And the secondary data is collected through
            journals, websites etc. Chi-square, weighted score ranking etc are used to analyse the collected data.
            Accuracy is dependent of responder’s point of view. Majority of the responders were males, married and
            mostly in between 20 and 30. New trends, reasonable price, quality of the product were the main factors that
            affected choosing an outlet. The problems faced was high price, quality impairment etc. Reliance trends were
            the first preference of the consumers which provided quality product in affordable cost. The results
            suggested that the customers were cheerful because of the service retail stores provided.</p>
        <h3 id="general-background">CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR OF APPAREL INDUSTRY IN DELHI</h3>
        <p>The work done by Dr. Sandeep Kumar [3] on consumer behaviour in the apparel industry in Delhi was reviewed.
            This research was conducted to study the socio-economic features of customers who prefer branded products
            and the factors affecting their decision. People prefer branded apparels as they are trendy, shows prestige,
            durable and high standard. By make in India and Silk India policies, India will be a global fashion centre
            soon. Retailers are providing values to both producers and consumers by providing different services to both
            the parties. Random sample of 200 people were taken for studies which mostly consists of females. The age is
            in the younger side and income is more than 2.4 lakh for most of the responders. The responders who have
            preference towards branded clothes also have preference to specific stores as well. In effective after sale
            services were one of the main concerns. The purchasing pattern of relatives and friends also have an impact
            in the consumer behaviour of an individual. The results of the study suggested that the customers have brand
            awareness. The factors affecting purchase are durability, diversity in the collection, high standards, etc.
            In the study, it was also clear that purchasing behaviour also depends on the demographics of the
            population.</p>
        <h3 id="general-background">ONLINE APPAREL PURCHASE BEHAVIOUR OF CONSUMERS</h3>
        <p>Dr. Garima Mathur et al. [4] studied the online apparel purchase behaviour of consumers in Indore City.
            Online shopping become the one of the major motivations to use internet now a days. People have access to
            wide range of products and services. The factors affecting conventional instore purchasing cannot be applied
            to the online purchasing behaviour. Both need separate analysis and tailored services to meet the customers'
            needs. This can be also applied to segment customers as well. The study suggests that online shopping become
            the alternative to instore because of its security, convenience and product quality. Another bigger
            advantage of online shopping is that it will provide customized shopping experience to its customers with
            lesser transactional cost. And, when retail business moves to online which will create a lot of new job
            opportunities. 300 consumers were taken from various parts of Indore for the survey and asked a set of
            structured questions. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics tools and chi-square test. Majority
            of the responders were male and most of the responders were above 35. The monthly income of most of the
            responders in the range 20000-40000 and most of them were postgraduates. The study gave great insights into
            the spending behaviour of consumers, choice of preferences on various collections, and website preferences
            for shopping. The study suggests that with the rise of social media platforms, brands must focus on
            marketing through social media. Study also suggested that people were not willing to pay more than 5000 in
            online for apparel purchase considering online security and high price. The study has given a lot of great
            insights for retailers for their future strategies.
            Vinith Kumar Nair et al. [6] studied the consumer behaviour in men’s fashion apparel. 500 young males were
            part of the study and it suggested to select one apparel quality, comfort and design were important. The
            study shows people prefer online shopping than instore. Social media ads and TV ads has significant
            influence in the purchases of the individuals. The study also shows that age and income have a greater
            influence in the purchasing frequency of the consumer.</p>

        <h3 id="general-background">RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</h3>
        <p>As part of this study, the features of textile purchase and its dependency towards various demographic
            features of the consumers were planned to study using chi-square test with the help of python. Following are
            the features taken to test dependency and the corresponding hypothesis formulated.<br>
            Customer can have preference towards customization of the clothes, It can be readymade or custom tailored.
            To study how age is associated with customization preference, hypothesis is created.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between age and customization preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between age and customization preference.<br>
            Customer can have preference towards mode of purchasing clothes, It can be online or conventional instore
            mode. To study how gender is associated with mode preference, hypothesis is created.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between gender and mode preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between gender and mode preference.<br>
            Annual income of an individual has direct relationship with purchasing power of that person. But whether it
            have a positive or negative significance towards that that person’s spending on textile purchase need to
            determine. To study how income is associated with spending on textile purchase, hypothesis is created.
            Hypothesis were also created to determine the association of education and occupation of the customer on
            their average annual spending for textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between income and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between income and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between education and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between education and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between occupation and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between occupation and spending on textile purchase.<br>
            Locality is the demographic features shows what type of society a consumer is located in. Different types of
            cities to villages, people are living in different areas. How locality is influencing the fashion choice and
            mode of purchasing, hypothesis is created.<br>
            <b>H0:</b> There is no significant association between locality type and mode preference.<br>
            <b>H1:</b> There is significant association between locality type and mode preference.<br>

        <h3 id="general-background">RESEARCH PLAN</h3>
        <p>
            A descriptive study is conducted to analyse the behaviour and preferences of textile customers in India in the age
            group 18-40 (adults). Customers are the key to the success of every industry. What are customers’ wants and needs,
            What are the factors affecting their purchasing behaviour, etc. need to be studied thoroughly. The factors affecting
            will change rapidly with time. So, studies of consumer behaviour should be conducted constantly to provide the best
            service possible and to expand the business to gain more customers that will be loyal to the brand. Loyalty
            customers create more purchasing opportunity for a business than random purchases. To keep the customers, customer
            behaviour and preferences need to thoroughly analyse, and strategies need to be created to stay competitive in
            market. Customer behaviour analysis is developed as a psychological analysis to create better business plans. With
            the help of machine learning and data analysis tools, customer behaviour can be easily analysed and visually
            appealing and easily understanding results can be formulated.<br>
            Primary data is collected through the questionnaire in the form of Google Forms and reached out to people through
            social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. The responses are collected from respondents from
            various genders, ages, educational qualifications, occupations, income groups, different zones of India, etc. Data
            regarding their preferences on the mode of purchase, the material of purchase, influencing factors, and brand
            awareness details are collected.<br>
            Data collected is cleaned and analysed with the help of R, Power BI, Excel and Tableau. The dependency of various
            categorical variables was studied using chi-square test using python. Hypothesis were created for testing the
            association between these categorical variables that is part of purchasing behaviour and demographic variables of
            the customer. Correlation matrices were created and analysed for various factors affecting customer preferences.
            Various data visualizations and dashboards are created using python, tableau and power BI.<br>

        <p>Conventional bitumen has been modified using addition of various additives since years. Among these studies,
            theone with the addition of crumb rubber was the earliest. Discarded tyres from vehicles were used to modify
            the bituminous mixes. They were ground to different sizes and graded like aggregates. For a well graded mix,
            about 10% crumb rubber in bitumen was found to improve the rutting resistance and while gap graded mixes had
            longer fatigue life but poor rutting resistance (Palit et al. 2004)[9]. Addition of crumb rubber into
            bitumen was found to be one way of reducing the quantity of waste generated but even then it was
            uneconomical considering the costs incurred in grinding and grading of the waste tyres. Thus other additives
            like latex, nanomaterials etc. came into effect and the studies became prominent. Bitumen with 7% latex by
            weight of bitumen exhibited least temperature sensitivity, enhanced fatigue and rutting resistance (Wen et
            al. 2015)[5]. On the other hand, 4% latex by weight of bitumen was found to be the optimum content by
            varying the concentration of latex from 0 to 6% (Siswanto 2016)[1]. The rate of deterioration in the
            modified mixes were decreased since the addition of latex improved the dynamic stability. Moreover the shelf
            life of the modified mix was improved due to better dispersion of natural rubber latex in bitumen owing to
            its small particle size (Siswanto 2017)[3]. About 15% natural rubber latex in bitumen obtained lower
            penetration value as well as reduced penetration index, increased softening point and highest rutting
            resistance (Bakar et al. 2018)[6]. The mixing variables like mixing time, mixing temperature and mixing
            speed had influence on the properties of the modified blends so obtained. These variables affect the
            dispersion of modifiers in bitumen and thus the strength of the mix thus prepared. A mixing time of 60
            minutes, mixing temperature of 160°C and a mixing speed of 1270 rpm was found to be the optimum values of
            mixing variables (Shaffie et al. 2018)[8]. Later studies were conducted with a combination of additives in
            bitumen. The optimum content of crumb rubber-HDPE mixture in bitumen was 8% while it was 6% for crumb
            rubber-LDPE mixture (Ghorpade and Desai 2018)[7].</p>

        <p>The particle shape is determined in terms of flakiness and elongation index. The aggregates were sieved
            through IS sieves of sizes 20 mm, 16 mm, 12.5 mm, 10 mm and 6.3 mm. A certain amount of fraction retained on
            each of the sieves were taken and passed through the length gauge and thickness gauge. The aggregates

            elongated. According to the MORTH specifications shape of aggregates is determined using combined elongation
            and flakiness index. Flakiness Index test was carried out in the selected sample of aggregates. The flaky
            particles passing through the respective slots of the thickness gauge were removed and the Elongation Index
            test was carried out in the remaining non-flaky particles and the Elongation Index so obtained was noted as

        <p>The Marshall stability and flow test provides the performance prediction measure for the Marshall mix design
            method. The stability portion of the test measures the maximum load supported by the test specimen at a
            loading rate of 50.8 mm/minute (2 inches/minute). Basically, the load is increased until it reaches a
            maximum then when the load just begins to decrease, the loading is stopped and the maximum load is recorded.
        </p>

        <p>During the loading, an attached dial gauge measures the specimen’s plastic flow as a result of the loading.
            The flow value is recorded in 0.25 mm (0.01 inch) increments at the same time the maximum load is recorded.

        <p>The optimum bitumen binder content is finally selected based on the combined results of Marshall stability
            and flow, density analysis and void analysis. Optimum bitumen binder content can be arrived at in the
            following procedure:</p>

        <p>Plot the following graphs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. density: Density will generally increase with increasing bitumen content,
                reach a maximum, then decrease. Peak density usually occurs at a higher bitumen binder content than peak
                stability.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. Marshall stability: This should follow one of two trends: Stability increases
                with increasing bitumen binder content, reaches a peak, then decreases. or Stability decreases with
                increasing bitumen binder content and does not show a peak. This curve is common for some recycled HMA
                mixtures.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. flow.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. air voids. Percent air voids should decrease with increasing bitumen binder
                content.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. VMA. Percent VMA should decrease with increasing bitumen binder content,
                reach a minimum, then increase.</li>
            <li>Bitumen binder content vs. VFB. Percent VFB increases with increasing bitumen binder content.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Determine the bitumen binder content that corresponds to the specifications median air void content
            (typically this is 3-5 percent). This is the optimum bitumen binder content.</p>

        <p>Determine properties at this optimum bitumen binder content by referring to the plots. Compare each of these
            values against specification values and if all are within specification, then the preceding optimum bitumen
            binder content is satisfactory.</p>

            thoroughly, poured onto the heated aggregate and evenly mixed as shown in fig. 2. The mix is placed in a
            preheated mould and compacted by a rammer with 75 blows on either side. The bitumen content was varied in
            the next trial by +0.5% and the above procedure was repeated from 5.0% to 7.0% of total mixture weight.

            prepared for testing. However, this blend prepared resulted in a thick blend with reduced workability.
            Increasing the percentage of latex in bitumen gradually reduced the workability. Hence, the blend with 9% of
            latex content was discarded and further tests were not conducted on the same. Thus 8% of latex by weight of

        <p>The maximum load which each of the specimen of different binder content at 0% and 8% latex-bitumen blend
            could withstand were determined along with the deformation occurred at that time. The theoretical specific
            gravity (Gt) and bulk specific gravity (Gm) for the specimens were calculated. These values were then used

            of binder content for specimens with 8% latex content. On an average, the optimum binder content for pure
            bitumen specimens was fixed as 6.14% and that of 8% latex-bitumen blend was 5.55%. For the purpose of study,
            specimens with 7% latex-bitumen blend were also prepared for different binder contents and all the above
            parameters were studied. But the results obtained were poor compared to the specimens of 8% latex-bitumen
            blend. Hence, a binder content of 5.55% with 8% latex in bitumen was found to the best mix.</p>

        <p>In this study, the performance of latex DRC60 modified bituminous concrete wearing course was studied. The
            properties of base materials were first studied and then the optimum content of latex DRC60 to be added to
            modify the bitumen was estimated, which was found to be 8% by weight of bitumen. The bituminous concrete mix
            proportioning was done and the Marshall specimens were prepared with 0% and 8% latex-bitumen blends for a
            binder content of 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 and 7%. On testing the specimens it was found that the addition of latex
            DRC60 could improve the strength of the mix as well as reduce the deformations. Each of the preliminary
            tests conducted to determine the properties of aggregates and bitumen suggests their suitability to be used
            in the wearing course of pavement. The tests conducted on bitumen modified with 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8% latex
            revealed that</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The penetration of bitumen decreases, while the softening point, ductility and specific gravity
                increases with increase in latex content.</li>
            <li>The optimum values for the tests were obtained for 8% latex in bitumen. A trial blend of 9% latex was
                prepared and discarded since the workability offered was poor.</li>
            <li>The lower penetration value and higher ductility and softening point suggested that the blend could be
                used in warmer regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With this 8% latex modified bitumen, mix proportioning was done which satisfied the MORTH specifications. The
            samples with pure bitumen and modified bitumen were prepared, tested and compared for Marshall stability and
            flow value as well as for density and void analysis which showed that</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The peak of Marshall stability and bulk specific gravity and the valley of Marshall flow value were
                obtained at lower binder contents for samples of modified bitumen compared to samples of pure bitumen.
            </li>
            <li>The optimum binder content for modified bituminous mix was thus found to be 5.55% while it was 6.14% for
                pure bituminous mix.</li>
            <li>This suggested that the desired strength and durability is obtained with modified bituminous mix and
                that it can reduce about 16% of bitumen in the mix compared to pure bituminous mix.</li>
            <li>Trial mix specimens prepared for 7% latex in bitumen was discarded as it obtained poor results. Thus, a
                bituminous mix with 8% latex by weight of bitumen at 5.55% binder content was fixed to be the optimum
                mix.</li>
