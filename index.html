                <b>Analysis To Study Customer Behaviour And Preferences In The Textile Retail Market Of Indian Adults (Age 18 To 40 Years)</b><br>
                Clothes are one of the major necessities of humans. Consumer analysis will provide great insight into consumer behaviour and preferences, which will help to improve businesses. By studying the demographic features and changes in preferences that depend on demographic features will help to customize each service to each group based on the requirements.A descriptive study is conducted to analyse the behaviour and preferences of textile customers in India in the age group 18-40 (adults). Customers are the key to the success of every industry. What are customers’ wants and needs, What are the factors affecting their purchasing behaviour, etc. need to be studied thoroughly. The factors affecting will change rapidly with time. So, studies of consumer behaviour should be conducted constantly to provide the best service possible and to expand the business to gain more customers that will be loyal to the brand.
                Primary data is collected through the questionnaire in the form of Google Forms and reached out to people through social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. The responses are collected from respondents from various genders, ages, educational qualifications, occupations, income groups, different zones of India, etc. Data regarding their preferences on the mode of purchase, the material of purchase, influencing factors, and brand awareness details are collected. Chi square test conducted on certain features of customer textile purchases to determine its dependency to the demographic features of the customers. The major findings are The gender of a person and locality they are living in doesn’t have any significant relationship to the mode of purchase like online or instore. But the fashion choice that a person chooses has a significant relation to the locality they are living in. Education, occupation and income of the customer has a significant role in the spending on textile purchase. Age and customization are related. The older adults like tailored customized dress whereas younger adults prefer readymade dresses. With the help of world cloud, It is found that the most common word that Indian young adults used to describe they purchases is casual. The most preferred dress materials are cotton and denim whereas most preferred colour is black.<br>

                <b>Experimental Evaluation on Latex DRC60 Modified Bituminous Concrete Wearing Course</b><br>
                Bituminous concrete wearing course is that part of the pavement upon which traffic travels which is likely to undergo early deterioration. This necessitates the need for frequent maintenance and there by increases the expenditure. Since the problem of deterioration is related to the properties of bituminous concrete mix, researches have been conducted to improve the properties of the mix using additives like nanomaterials, marble dust, latex etc. The objective of this study is to modify pure bitumen using latex DRC60 and evaluate the physical properties of the blend so as to determine its optimum content in bitumen. Further Marshall mix design was carried out for bituminous concrete layer using the modified latex bitumen blend at various binder contents. The specimens were tested for Marshall stability and flow values as well as the density and void calculations. The studies conducted showed that bitumen modified with latex DRC60 had better physical properties and the modified mix had better strength compared to that of conventional bitumen.<br>
